## Closet Storage App Project Proposal

## Project Abstraction

This project is named ClosetStorageApp and what it fundamentally does is that it helps the user keeps an organized profile of the apparel that they own. Tired of not knowing what you already wore and tossed in the laundry basket? Tired of having unorganized apparel? Do you spend a lot of your time changing outfits because outfits do not go together or fit conditions of outside weather/events? Closet Storage App is designed to help you keep a bookkeeping of all the apparel that you own. It is akin to that of a store’s stock inventory when browsing their website for example. You have your own closet storage, and within that closet storage you have a category that consists of objects like hats, pants (and within pants, jeans, skinny jeans, sweatpants, etc.), shirt and so on. You can view what you have in your closet, and to help you keep them organized you can also organize them into a list and view them as a list so you know what order your shirts are in and where they will be at.

## Project Relevance

How I think my proposal will be linked to the educational goals of this class will be from that fact that this idea is a start from scratch idea. Therefore, when designing this idea from nothing to build upon you need to have a good design pattern in order for well future maintenance, and that of the life of this project. With that in mind, I also believe that this project will need implementations of objects, so object orientated design will also play a part in this project. This project also could easily make use of a GUI (Graphical User Interface). Having a list would be nice to view and read what you have but implementing a GUI to see actual photos would make the project more interactive and interesting to use. I’m sure there are more things that we can implement with this project, maybe a database? But so far, with the start of the idea, there is a good amount of knowledge needed to work on this project, so drawing a UML diagram will definitely help get things started. I think these goals will be of importance because it’ll help teach us how to develop a project from the beginning. Also, understand and implementing object orientation is also very important since it is widely used by companies.

## Conceptual Design

What I want to contribute to this project is the design pattern. I believe that having a good design pattern is the key to having a good foundation of the overall project. Which means before implementing any type of code we need to design the project not so directly. I want to be able to map out the project and have classes where classes need to be. For example, should we have different classes for types like hat, pants, socks, shoes. Do they all inherit from something? I want to be able to ask myself such questions to be able to identify any problems that may come in the future. I also want to contribute to the source code, more towards the GUI implementation. When a user clicks on a certain label, the GUI should respond to that action do what is expected to do based on the event.
